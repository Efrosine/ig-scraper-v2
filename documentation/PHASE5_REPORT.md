# Phase 5 Report: Search by Location or Suspected Account

## Overview
Phase 5 successfully implements search functionality for Instagram posts using two distinct algorithms:
1. **Location-Based Search** - Searches posts by geographical location
2. **Suspected Account Search** - Searches posts from specific user accounts

## Implementation Details

### Core Components Created

#### 1. Location Search Module (`location_search.py`)
- **Purpose**: Implements location-based search with its specific algorithm
- **Key Features**:
  - Navigates to Instagram explore page
  - Uses search functionality to find location-specific posts
  - Handles location suggestions and place selection
  - Collects posts from location pages with scroll functionality
  - Provides location search capability verification

#### 2. Suspected Account Search Module (`suspected_account_search.py`)  
- **Purpose**: Implements suspected account search with its specific algorithm
- **Key Features**:
  - Directly navigates to user profile pages
  - Checks profile accessibility (public/private/banned)
  - Extracts account information (username, bio, post count)
  - Collects posts from user profiles with scroll functionality
  - Provides account search capability verification

#### 3. Enhanced Logging System (`output_logger.py`)
- **Purpose**: Provides comprehensive logging for search operations
- **Key Features**:
  - Session-based logging with unique IDs
  - Separate log files for different operation types
  - Performance metrics tracking
  - Error logging with context
  - Search operation detailed logging

#### 4. Updated Main Module (`main.py`)
- **Enhanced with Phase 5 capabilities**:
  - Integration of both search algorithms
  - Standardized JSON output format
  - Session management for search operations
  - Quality scoring and data cleaning integration

#### 5. Phase 5 Main File (`phase5_scraper.py`)
- **Purpose**: Coordinates between the two search methods
- **Key Features**:
  - Command-line interface for both search types
  - Interactive search mode
  - Argument parsing for automated runs
  - Results display and summary

#### 6. Comprehensive Testing (`test_phase5.py`)
- **Purpose**: Tests both search algorithms thoroughly
- **Test Coverage**:
  - Location search algorithm testing
  - Suspected account search algorithm testing
  - Output logger functionality testing
  - Error handling validation
  - Data structure compatibility testing

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Mutually Exclusive Search Types
- **Location Search**: Searches posts by geographical location using Instagram's location functionality
- **Account Search**: Searches posts from specific suspected accounts by directly accessing their profiles
- **Validation**: Ensures only one search type is used per session

### 2. Distinct Algorithms
- **Location Algorithm**: Uses Instagram's explore and location search features
- **Account Algorithm**: Direct profile navigation and post extraction
- **Separation**: Each algorithm is implemented in its own module with specific logic

### 3. Enhanced Logging
- **Session Tracking**: Each search session has a unique ID
- **Multiple Log Types**: Detailed, error, search, and performance logs
- **Contextual Information**: Logs include search type, target, and operation details

### 4. Standardized Output
- **Consistent Format**: Both search types produce the same JSON structure
- **Metadata**: Includes search type, target, timing, and session information
- **Quality Scoring**: Integrates with existing data cleaning and quality assessment

### 5. GUI Operation
- **Non-Headless Mode**: Browser runs with visible GUI as requested
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Users can see the scraping process in action
- **Screenshot Capability**: Takes screenshots for verification

## Configuration

### Environment Variables (.env)
```bash
# Phase 5 Default Search Parameters
DEFAULT_LOCATION=Malang
DEFAULT_SUSPECTED_ACCOUNT=malangraya_info
DEFAULT_POST_COUNT=10
DEFAULT_COMMENT_COUNT=5
```

### Account Credentials
- **Primary Account**: eprosine009:IniPwBaru123
- **Backup Account**: eprosen2:desember@03
- **Login Strategy**: One account at a time with automatic backup switching

## Usage Examples

### 1. Location Search
```bash
# Interactive mode
python phase5_scraper.py --mode interactive

# Direct location search
python phase5_scraper.py --mode location --target "Malang" --posts 10 --comments 5
```

### 2. Suspected Account Search
```bash
# Direct account search
python phase5_scraper.py --mode account --target "malangraya_info" --posts 10 --comments 5
```

### 3. Programmatic Usage
```python
from phase5_scraper import Phase5InstagramScraper

scraper = Phase5InstagramScraper()

# Location search
location_results = scraper.run_location_search("Malang", 10, 5)

# Account search
account_results = scraper.run_suspected_account_search("malangraya_info", 10, 5)
```
